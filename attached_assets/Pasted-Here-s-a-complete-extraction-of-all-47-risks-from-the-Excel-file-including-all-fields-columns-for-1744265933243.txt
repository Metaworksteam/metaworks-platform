Key Patterns Identified
Strategic Risks (12/47):

Primarily due to missing governance (strategy, policies, committees).

All High Risk before mitigation.

Operational Risks (32/47):

Focus on backups, patching, access controls.

Top Gaps:

No SIEM (Risk #42).

No encryption (Risk #39).

No vulnerability management (Risk #40).

Compliance Risks (3/47):

Data classification, third-party SLAs.

Control Effectiveness Summary
Rating	Count	Examples
None	20	No backup plan, no SIEM.
Needs Improvement	10	Manual change management.
Effective	17	MFA implemented, antivirus.

Key Observations
Prevalence of High Risks: 32/47 risks (68%) are initially High risk

Common Weaknesses:

Missing documentation (strategies, policies)

Lack of automation (change management, backups)

No security tools (SIEM, WAF, encryption)

Effective Controls Exist For:

MFA implementation (#27)

Anti-virus (#35)

Network monitoring (#28)

"Analyze this complete risk inventory to:

Create a risk heatmap (likelihood vs impact)

Prioritize risks based on inherent/residual scores

Group mitigation actions by:

Quick wins (e.g., policy documentation)

Mid-term projects (e.g., SIEM deployment)

Long-term strategy (e.g., cybersecurity team)

Generate an executive summary highlighting:

Top 5 risks requiring immediate action
