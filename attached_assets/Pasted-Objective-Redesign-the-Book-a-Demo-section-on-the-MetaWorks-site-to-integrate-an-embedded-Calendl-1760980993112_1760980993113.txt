Objective:
Redesign the “Book a Demo” section on the MetaWorks site to integrate an embedded Calendly scheduler directly into the right-hand side of the section, allowing users to book a slot seamlessly within the same page.

Functional Requirements

Left Section (Keep As-Is):

Retain the existing content under “What You’ll Get” (Personalized Demo, Expert Consultation, ROI Analysis, Free Trial Access).

Preserve all icons, text hierarchy, and current visual alignment.

Right Section (Replace Existing Form):

Replace the form fields and “Request Demo” button with an embedded Calendly scheduling interface, allowing users to select a time slot directly.

Use the Calendly inline embed (not redirect).

<div class="calendly-inline-widget" 
     data-url="https://calendly.com/abdullaharoomi/30min" 
     style="min-width:320px; height:650px;">
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" 
        src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" async>
</script>


Unified Layout:

Merge both the left and right sections into a single combined rectangular container.

Maintain a two-column layout (left = info, right = Calendly booking UI).

On mobile (<900px), collapse into one column (Calendly below the info section).

Design & Styling

Gradient Background:

Use the same gradient colors currently applied to the right-side information box (the one visible in the screenshot).

Apply this gradient across the entire combined rectangle, ensuring visual consistency.

Container Styling:

Rounded corners: 16px.

Padding: 40px internal spacing.

Soft box-shadow for elevation (similar to the current right-side box).

Ensure no clipping or cutoff occurs during scroll.

Calendly Box Styling:

Integrate seamlessly with the background gradient (no separate background color).

Rounded corners and subtle transparency to match brand tone.

Maintain full height alignment with the left section content.

Typography:

Headings: Bright aqua #00f0ff.

Body text: rgba(255,255,255,0.85).

Font family consistent with current MetaWorks site.

Responsive Behavior

On desktop: Two-column layout (50/50 split).

On tablet/mobile: Stack vertically, with Calendly appearing below the “What You’ll Get” content.

Ensure gradient remains visible and consistent across all viewports.

Outcome

A single, unified gradient-styled rectangle combining:

Left: The “What You’ll Get” section (unchanged).

Right: An inline Calendly booking interface where users can instantly view available time slots and confirm a meeting without leaving the page.

The entire section should feel cohesive, modern, and aligned with the MetaWorks visual brand — offering a smooth, integrated demo booking experience that enhances conversion and professionalism.
