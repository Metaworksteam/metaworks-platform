Here's a comprehensive AI prompt for your requirement:

AI-Powered Integrated Compliance Assessment System
Objective:
Create an end-to-end solution that:

Conducts automated assessments for NCA ECC, SAMA, and PDPL frameworks

Stores all data in a centralized database

Provides multiple viewing options

Generates downloadable/printable reports

Displays real-time scores on an interactive dashboard

Detailed Requirements:

Assessment Engine:

Implement framework-specific evaluation modules:

NCA ECC: Control-by-control scoring (0-100%)

SAMA: Maturity level assessment (Baseline to Leading)

PDPL: Article compliance tracking (Compliant/Non-Compliant)

Automated evidence collection via:

System APIs for technical controls

Document analysis for policy reviews

User questionnaires for procedural checks

Database Architecture:

Relational database structure with:

Assessment_results table (timestamp, framework, overall_score)

Control_details table (control_ID, status, evidence, remarks)

Action_plans table (gap_ID, owner, due_date, status)

Full audit trail of all assessment activities

Version control for historical comparisons

Dashboard Visualization:

Real-time compliance scoring display with:

Framework comparison view

Trend analysis graphs (last 6 assessments)

Risk heat maps (by domain/category)

Progress tracking against targets

Drill-down capability to control-level details

Alert system for critical non-compliances

Reporting Module:

Automated report generation in:

PDF (print-optimized format)

Excel (with raw scoring data)

PowerPoint (executive summary)

Customizable report sections:

Assessment methodology

Detailed findings

Risk prioritization matrix

Remediation roadmap

One-click export functionality

User Interface:

Role-based access control:

Assessors (full access)

Reviewers (view + comment)

Executives (dashboard only)

Multi-view options:

Framework-specific views

Combined risk overview

Comparative analysis
