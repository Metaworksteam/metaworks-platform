AI Prompt: Automated Risk Assessment Dashboard with Live Scoring
Objective
Build an AI-driven dashboard that:
âœ” Displays real-time compliance scores for NCA ECC, SAM, and PDPL assessments
âœ” Visualizes risk levels (High/Medium/Low) with drill-down capabilities
âœ” Tracks progress vs. previous assessments and target benchmarks
âœ” Generates alerts for critical failures or declining scores

1. Dynamic Scoring Engine
Automated scoring per framework:

NCA ECC: % compliance per domain (e.g., "Access Control: 85%")

SAM: Maturity level (Baseline/Developing/Advanced/Leading)

PDPL: Article-by-article compliance status (Compliant/Partially/Non-Compliant)

Weighted risk calculation (Impact Ã— Likelihood) for prioritized remediation

2. Dashboard Visualization Requirements
A. Executive Summary Widget
Traffic Light Overview:

ðŸŸ¢ Green (â‰¥85% compliant)

ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (70-84%)

ðŸ”´ Red (<70%)

Trend Arrows: Show improvement/decline vs. last assessment (e.g., "SAM: 78% â–²2%")

B. Framework-Specific Scorecards
âœ… NCA ECC

Bar chart: Compliance % per domain (Governance, Access Control, etc.)

Top 3 Risks: List controls with the lowest scores

Industry Benchmark Comparison: Show gap vs. sector average

âœ… SAM Framework

Radar chart: Maturity across 5 capability areas

Gap Analysis: Visualize missing controls for target maturity level

âœ… PDPL

Compliance Heatmap: Articles with pass/fail status

Data Flow Map: Highlight high-risk processing activities

C. Risk Prioritization Panel
Top 5 Critical Risks across all frameworks

Remediation Progress: Track open/closed actions

3. Database Integration for Historical Tracking
Store all scores with timestamps for trend analysis

Compare multiple assessments (e.g., "Q3 2023 vs. Q2 2023")

Export score data to CSV/PDF for audits

4. Sample Dashboard Output

[LIVE DASHBOARD - EXAMPLE]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
| Overall Compliance: 80% (NCA ECC: 85% | SAM: 75% | PDPL: 72%)     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NCA ECC DOMAINS       | SCORE | TREND  | RISK LEVEL              |
|-----------------------|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| Access Control        | 92%   | â–²1%    | Low                     |
| Incident Response     | 68%   | â–¼5%    | High (Critical)         |
| Data Encryption       | 81%   | â–º      | Medium                  |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[TOP RISKS]  
1. SAM-DM-08: No data retention policy (High)  
2. NCA-IR-04: Missing incident playbook (High)  
3. PDPL-ART-22: No DPIA for cloud processing (Medium)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[ACTIONS REQUIRED] Â» 3 Critical | 12 Medium | 5 Low  
5. AI Enhancements for Scoring Accuracy
Auto-adjust weights based on regulatory updates

Predictive scoring: Forecast future compliance based on current trends

Natural language summaries: "Access Control improved due to new PAM tool"

Next Steps?

Should I add specific scoring formulas for each framework?

Include dashboard UI mockups?

Add integration with SIEM/GRC tools for auto-data pull?
