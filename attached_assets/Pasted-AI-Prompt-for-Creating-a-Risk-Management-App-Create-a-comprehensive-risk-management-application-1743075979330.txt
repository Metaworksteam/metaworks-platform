AI Prompt for Creating a Risk Management App:

"Create a comprehensive risk management application for an IT department that addresses the identified risks from the assessment. The app should include the following features:

Risk Dashboard:

Display all risks categorized by type (Strategic, Operational) and severity (High, Medium).

Visualize risk trends (e.g., likelihood vs. impact) using charts/graphs.

Risk Tracking & Mitigation:

Allow users to log risks with details like title, description, category, owner, likelihood, impact, and inherent/residual risk levels.

Enable tracking of mitigation actions (e.g., assign tasks, set deadlines like 'Q2 2025', mark completion status).

Include automated reminders for pending actions (e.g., policy reviews, patch testing).

Documentation & Compliance:

Provide templates for IT policies, procedures, and frameworks (e.g., Cybersecurity Policies, Backup Plans).

Store and version-control documents (e.g., IT Strategy, Asset Classification Guidelines).

Asset Management:

Track IT assets (EOL/EOS status, disposal records) with alerts for outdated systems.

Integrate with automated tools for asset discovery and lifecycle management.

Security & Incident Management:

Log and prioritize incidents with severity levels.

Include workflows for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and post-implementation reviews.

Recommend tools (e.g., SIEM, WAF) and link to threat databases.

Training & Awareness:

Schedule cybersecurity training sessions and track employee participation.

Provide resources (e.g., phishing simulation, encryption guidelines).

Reporting:

Generate reports for stakeholders (e.g., risk heatmaps, mitigation progress).

Export data to Excel/PDF for audits.

Technical Requirements:

User roles (Admin, IT Staff, Management) with tailored views.

Cloud-based with offline capabilities.

APIs for integration with tools like ManageEngine, CrowdStrike.

Design:

Intuitive UI with color-coded risk indicators (Red/Amber/Green).

Mobile-responsive for remote access.

Example Workflow:

User logs a risk (e.g., 'Absence of Encryption').

App suggests mitigation steps (e.g., 'Define cryptographic standards by Q2 2025').

Assigns task to IT Department and alerts when deadline approaches.

Focus on scalability to add future risks and compliance standards (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)."
