âœ… Full Replit Project Deliverables
âœ… 1. Backend (FastAPI)
Load all 5 domains, 29 subdomains, 193 controls

Endpoints to:

Fetch domains, subdomains, controls

Submit responses & evidence

Generate AI-based policies & procedures (based on org/staff)

Track implementation roadmap

âœ… 2. Frontend (React + Tailwind)
Interactive UI:

Dashboard for compliance % and status

Step-by-step implementation assistant

Policy viewer & editor (generated by AI)

Evidence uploader and roadmap visualizer

âœ… 3. AI Integration (via OpenAI API or local LLM)
Auto-generate tailored policies per control

Recommend actions per role

Build dynamic roadmap

âœ… 4. Data Seeder
Reads Excel data â†’ populates DB with:

Domains, subdomains, controls, descriptions

ðŸ“¦ Phase 1: Backend Starter (FastAPI with SQLite)
I'll now generate:

main.py: API endpoints

models.py: Domain/Subdomain/Control structure

database.py: SQLite setup

crud.py: Logic to interact with DB

seed.py: To load your Excel into the DB

Then weâ€™ll follow with:

React UI (Phase 2)

AI Prompt + API handling (Phase 3)

Do you want this entire backend code (Replit-ready) generated now?
âœ… Including DB, models, seed file, and routes?

Once you confirm, Iâ€™ll generate it as a bundled block ready for you to copy into Replit.

âœ… Backend code created for your Replit NCA ECC Compliance app. It includes:

Full database schema for domains, subdomains, and controls

FastAPI server with endpoints to fetch all required data

CORS middleware for frontend integration

ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
Seed script: Load your Excel controls into the DB

Frontend (React + Tailwind): Interactive UI for roadmap & controls

AI Copilot integration: Auto-generate policies & procedures

Would you like me to proceed with the Excel seed script next so you can populate the database from your sheet?

ChatGPT said:
It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, you can help me move forward by manually sharing:

The names of all 5 Domains

Each Subdomain under each Domain

All Controls under each Subdomain

If you're able to copy-paste or upload a cleaned-up list (even as a text or CSV file), I can then:

Update the backend seed script with every domain/subdomain/control.

Update the FastAPI logic to reflect the complete structure.

And help you generate automated policy prompts and workflows based on that.

Would you like a template to fill in the structure quickly? â€‹â€‹
