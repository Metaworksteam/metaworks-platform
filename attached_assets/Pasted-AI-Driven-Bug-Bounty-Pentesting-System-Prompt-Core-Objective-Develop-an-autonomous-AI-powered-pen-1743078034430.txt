AI-Driven Bug Bounty Pentesting System Prompt
Core Objective
"Develop an autonomous AI-powered penetration testing system designed specifically for bug bounty programs that intelligently discovers, verifies, and reports vulnerabilities while adhering to all platform rules and scope limitations."

Key Requirements
1. Target Acquisition & Scope Analysis
Automatically parse bug bounty program scope (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.)

Identify in-scope domains/subdomains using AI-powered OSINT

Detect and avoid out-of-scope/restricted assets

Generate legal authorization checks before scanning

2. Intelligent Attack Surface Mapping
Copy
AI Module Components:
- SubdomainEnumerator (ML-trained on DNS patterns)
- EndpointDiscoverer (analyzes JS/files for hidden routes)
- TechnologyFingerprinter (identifies frameworks with 98%+ accuracy)
3. Vulnerability Hunting Engine
Prioritized Targets:

OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Business logic flaws

API security issues

Cloud misconfigurations

AI-Assisted Tools Integration:

python
Copy
def run_scan(target):
    if is_web_app(target):
        return AI_ZAP_Scanner(target)  # Modified OWASP ZAP with ML
    elif is_api(target):
        return API_Fuzzer(target)  # AI-generated malformed inputs
    elif is_infrastructure(target):
        return Cloud_Security_Checker(target)
4. Smart Exploitation System
Auto-verifies vulnerabilities to reduce false positives

Generates PoC exploits with safety limits

Never performs destructive actions (no data deletion/modification)

Rate-limits requests to avoid service disruption

5. Automated Reporting & Submission
Generates bug bounty-ready reports with:

Clear impact analysis

Reproduction steps

CVSS scoring

Suggested fixes

Auto-formats for platform-specific requirements

Includes video/gif proof-of-concept when applicable

Ethical Constraints
python
Copy
class EthicalGuardrails:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_requests_per_minute = 60
        self.forbidden_actions = ['DROP TABLE', 'rm -rf', 'sudo']
        
    def check_actions(self, command):
        if any(bad_action in command for bad_action in self.forbidden_actions):
            raise SecurityViolation("Blocked dangerous action")

genrate  prompt for Vulnerabliity assessment by AI
Hereâ€™s a refined AI prompt to generate a Vulnerability Assessment System that automates security scanning, analysis, and reporting:

AI Prompt: "Develop an AI-Powered Vulnerability Assessment System"
Objective:
"Create an automated vulnerability assessment tool that uses AI to scan, analyze, and prioritize security weaknesses in web apps, APIs, and networks, while minimizing false positives and generating actionable reports."

Core Requirements:
1. Target Scanning & Discovery
Input: Accepts domains, IPs, or API endpoints.

AI-Assisted Discovery:

Auto-detects subdomains, hidden paths, and exposed services.

Maps attack surfaces using ML-trained pattern recognition.

Scope Compliance: Skips out-of-scope assets (for bug bounty use).

2. AI-Driven Vulnerability Detection
OWASP Top 10 Focus:

SQLi, XSS, SSRF, Broken Auth, etc.

Smart Scanning:

Uses Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Nuclei with AI-guided fuzzing.

Predictive Analysis: ML model predicts high-risk areas.

Low False Positives: AI cross-validates findings before reporting.

3. Automated Analysis & Exploit Verification
python
Copy
def verify_vulnerability(finding):
    if finding.type == "SQLi":
        return sqlmap.check(finding.url)  # Auto-verifies with SQLMap
    elif finding.type == "XSS":
        return xsstrike.validate(finding.url)  # Confirms exploitability
4. Risk Scoring & Prioritization
CVSS 3.1 Scoring: AI calculates severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low).

Business Impact Analysis: Considers data sensitivity, exposure.

5. Reporting & Remediation
Auto-Generated Reports:

Executive Summary (NLP-generated for non-tech stakeholders).

Technical Deep Dive (Proof-of-concept, curl commands).

Remediation Steps (OWASP Cheat Sheets, code patches).

Export Formats: PDF, Markdown, JSON (for JIRA/GitHub integration).

AI Models to Train/Use:
Vulnerability Prediction Model (Binary classification: Vulnerable/Not).

False Positive Reducer (Ensemble learning to filter noise).

Natural Language Report Generator (GPT-like model for summaries).

Sample Output Format:
markdown
Copy
## [Critical] SQL Injection in `/admin/login`  
- **CVSS:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
- **Proof of Concept:**  
  ```sql
  ' OR 1=1-- 
Remediation: Use parameterized queries. [OWASP Link]

Copy

### **Ethical Constraints:**  
- **Rate-Limiting:** Avoids DDoS-like behavior.  
- **No Unauthorized Testing:** Confirms scope/permissions first.  
- **Data Privacy:** Auto-redacts sensitive info (emails, tokens).  

---  

### **How to Use This Prompt:**  
1. **For an AI Chatbot (GPT-4/Claude):**  
   - Paste this prompt and ask: *"Generate Python code for the AI vulnerability scanner."*  
2. **For a Developer:**  
   - Refine with: *"Add a Docker setup for ZAP + AI integration."*  
3. **For a Pentester:**  
   - Ask: *"Show me a sample assessment report for a vulnerable WordPress site."*  

Would you like me to simulate an **AI-generated response** with code snippets? ðŸš€
