AI Prompt for ITGC and Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Report Generation
Objective:
Create a comprehensive AI-powered system that performs detailed risk assessments for IT General Controls (ITGC) and cybersecurity, generates printable reports, saves the output, and maintains a database of assessment results.

Detailed Prompt:
"Develop an AI-powered risk assessment tool that performs the following functions:

Risk Assessment Scope Definition:

Automatically identify all ITGC domains (access controls, change management, backup procedures, etc.)

Map all cybersecurity areas (network security, endpoint protection, data privacy, etc.)

Generate a customizable assessment framework based on industry standards (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, COBIT)

Detailed Assessment Process:

For each control area, generate specific evaluation criteria

Create weighted scoring based on risk impact and likelihood

Include automated control testing procedures where applicable

Incorporate threat modeling for cybersecurity components

Data Collection Interface:

Generate interactive questionnaires for manual input

Create API connectors for automated system data collection

Include document upload capabilities for evidence gathering

Implement natural language processing for analyzing policy documents

Risk Analysis Engine:

Calculate risk scores for each control area

Identify control gaps and vulnerabilities

Prioritize risks based on business impact

Generate heat maps and visual risk representations

Report Generation:

Create comprehensive PDF reports with:

Executive summary

Detailed findings

Risk ratings

Recommended remediation actions

Implementation timelines

Include visualizations (charts, graphs, matrices)

Allow customization of report templates

Database Integration:

Design a relational database schema to store:

Assessment results

Historical data

Control evidence

Remediation tracking

Implement CRUD operations for data management

Include version control for assessments

System Features:

User authentication and role-based access

Audit trail of all assessment activities

Automated reminders for reassessments

Integration capabilities with GRC platforms

Export functionality in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)

Output Requirements:

Generate printer-friendly reports with proper formatting

Save reports to designated cloud/local storage

Maintain database records with timestamps

Create executive dashboards for monitoring

The system should use AI to:

Learn from previous assessments to improve future evaluations

Suggest control improvements based on industry best practices

Automatically update risk profiles based on emerging threats

Provide natural language explanations of technical risks for different audiences

Include data validation and error handling throughout the process to ensure assessment accuracy and reliability."

Implementation Notes:
The system should be adaptable for different organizational sizes and industries

Include sample datasets for demonstration purposes

Provide API documentation for integration with other systems

Ensure all data handling complies with relevant privacy regulations

Include help documentation and tooltips throughout the interface
